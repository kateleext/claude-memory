# Use Cases

## Continuing with Clean Context

Your conversation got long. The context is bloated and Claude is starting to lose the thread. Start a fresh session and bring forward just what matters.

> "Recall where we landed on the authentication refactor. I want to continue from the token refresh approach we settled on, without rehashing the early exploration."

## Knowledge Transfer

You've been building something over multiple sessions and want to share what you learned with your team.

> "Look back at our past two weeks together and document how this project came together. My teammates will be maintaining this and I want them to understand the journey."

## Decision Archaeology

You're staring at code wondering why it's structured a certain way. The decision made sense at the time, but you've lost the context.

> "We chose polling over websockets at some point last month. Remind me why. I'm second-guessing it and need to remember what led us there."

## Picking Up Abandoned Work

Life happened. You started something weeks ago and never finished. Now you want to resume without re-explaining everything.

> "We started on a caching layer a few weeks back but I got pulled away. Where did we leave off? What had we already decided? I want to pick it back up."
