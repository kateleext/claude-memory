# Use Cases

## Continuing with Clean Context

Your conversation got long. The context is bloated and Claude is starting to lose the thread. Start a fresh session and bring forward just what matters.

> "Search for our last session on the authentication refactor. Pull chapter 3 where we finalized the token refresh approach. I want to continue from there without all the earlier exploration."

## Knowledge Transfer

You've been building something over multiple sessions and want to share what you learned with your team.

> "Use subagents to read through the past two weeks of sessions between us and create complete documentation for how this project came together. The goal is transferring what we learned to my teammates who will maintain this."

## Decision Archaeology

You're staring at code wondering why it's structured a certain way. The decision made sense at the time, but you've lost the context.

> "We decided to use polling instead of websockets somewhere in our conversations last month. Find where we discussed that and reconstruct the reasoning. I'm second-guessing it now and need to remember what constraints led us there."

## Picking Up Abandoned Work

Life happened. You started something weeks ago and never finished. Now you want to resume without re-explaining everything.

> "I started working on a caching layer with you a few weeks back but got pulled away. Find that session, tell me where we left off, and what decisions we'd already made. I want to pick it back up."
